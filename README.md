</Capabilities>
```

// Request to get access token
var authResult = await KKBOXOAuth.SignInAsync(clientId, clientSecret);
string accessToken = authResult.Content.AccessToken;
```

- Use KKBOX Open API:

```csharp
KKBOXAPI openAPI = new KKBOXAPI();
// Must setting access token
openAPI.AccessToken = accessToken;
// Must setting user territory
OpenAPI.TerritoryType = TerritoryType.TW;

// example get album metadata
var album = await openAPI.GetAlbumAsync(albumId);
```
